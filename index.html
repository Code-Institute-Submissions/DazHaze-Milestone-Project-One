                <p>Up until 1939 strawberries were imported from Britian and Holland into Ireland. As a result of World
                    War Two Ireland had to cultivate its own strawberries. Wexford, known as the "Sunny South East" of
                    Ireland, Became the perfect location to grow. Wexford strawberries have become so popular that there
                    is even a festival dedicated to the fruit. Now you can have these delicious strawberries delivered
                    right to your door!</p>

                <p>Eggs are always a great way to start your day. When buying eggs from the store it is hard to imagine
                    how different eggs that come from a small local farm really are. Once you get our eggs delivered to
                    you and start your day off with them, It will be impossible to go back to the store bought eggs.
                    This we promise!</p>

<h1>Welcome!</h1>

Website - https://dazhaze.github.io/Milestone-Project-One/index.html

Welcome to my first milestone project for Code Institute. This website aims to tell you a little about a small farm started by two people in the republic of ireland.

Users of this website will be able to see delicious recipes that are tailored to food items that the farm can offer. A recipe of the day will show the user what the people of farm people are cooking for the day.

<h2>Features</h2>

This website has an interesting logo design on the navbar on the main page. The circle logo grabs the users attention but it is also responsive in the fact that it is hidden on small devices where it would simply take up too much room.

A recipe of the day draws the user back to the site to see the updates recipe each day.

<h2>Coming next</h2>

Next I would like to add in seperate pages for each recipe when the user clicks on them. This will show the user the full recipe and even links on where to buy ingredients from trusted sources if the farm cannot supply them.

Instead of hiding the circle logo on smaller devices I would like to figure out a way to show it through more testing.

I would also like to add a newsletter section so the user has the option to sign up to the farm people newsletter via email. This would lead to the user receiving updates about what is available from the farm each week.

<h2>User testing</h2>

This website has been tested on devices of different sizes (ipad air, mobile phones and desktop monitors).

On all these devices the website funcionality remains acceptable and the layout of items changes accordingly.

The user has the same site experience across all devices.
